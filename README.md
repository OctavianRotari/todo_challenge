# ToDo challenge

This challenge was the number 7 on the list of weekend challenges of Makers Academy. The task was to build a simple ToDo app using AngularJs, because during the week we learnt how to use Angular for developing the front-end. I opted to go further and to implement it by adding the back-end using the other components of the MEAN stack, and also I used Grunt to automate the tasks.
